# Worklog

## 2026-03-01

- Source-level review of Rig (github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig) — Rust AI agent framework
  - 98K LOC Rust, v0.31.0, 911 commits, 21 months, 169 contributors (89% from one person)
  - Core value: best provider abstraction in Rust (20+ providers, 10+ vector stores, WASM)
  - Strengths: clean trait hierarchy, streaming, hooks, OpenTelemetry, MIT license
  - Weaknesses: thin testing (436 tests for 54K LOC, zero mocked providers, needs live API keys), 156 panics in production paths, no memory/orchestration
  - Verdict: excellent completion client library, weak as "agent framework" — the agent is just model + preamble + tools
  - Full analysis: `research/rig-review.md`
- Installed and researched Kiro CLI (v1.26.2) — AWS's terminal coding agent
  - Compared with Pi and Claude Code across architecture, pricing, tools, extensibility, sessions, benchmarks
  - Key findings: Kiro fastest in benchmarks (168s), unique built-in LSP/web search/AWS tools, but locked to Claude models via AWS credit system
  - Pi most extensible (TypeScript extensions, 20+ providers, session branching); Claude Code most powerful (Opus 4.5, deep autonomy)
  - Full analysis: `research/kiro-cli-vs-pi-vs-claude-code.md`
- Built `serper-search` pi skill as Google fallback for when Brave misses niche docs
  - `search.js` with `--content`, `--site`, `--period` flags
  - Reuses same Readability/Turndown content extraction as brave-search
  - SKILL.md documents when to use Serper vs Brave
  - Needs `SERPER_API_KEY` env var (free 2,500 queries at serper.dev, no CC)
- Researched search API landscape: what experts/practitioners actually use
  - Brave = benchmark winner (AIMultiple: 14.89, fastest at 669ms)
  - Tavily = popular due to LangChain ecosystem inertia, not quality superiority
  - Serper = best value ($1/1K), Google's index best for niche technical docs
  - Exa = specialist for semantic/code search, not worth adding (5 QPS, complex pricing, index gaps)
  - Decision: keep Brave as primary, Serper as fallback, skip Tavily and Exa
- Deep accuracy review of brave-search goggle optimization (all claims validated against live API + official docs)
  - Verified API param behavior: `goggles_id` silently ignored on LLM Context (200 OK, no filtering); `goggles` works for both hosted + inline
  - Fixed rule counts in goggles-reference.md: tech_blogs 1,295→1,469, banana-boost 7,468→7,838, netsec 3,896→3,903, hacker_news 6,238→6,239 (previous counts only counted `$boost=` lines, missed URL patterns + $discard + $downrank)
  - Fixed misleading descriptions: hacker_news/tech_blogs are **allow-lists** (global `$discard`), not just boosts; banana-boost embeds 190 copycats_removal discard rules
  - Fixed research file: split `$lang`/`$inquery` attribution — only in awesome-goggles repo, NOT in official Brave quickstart (which only lists `$intitle`/`$indescription`/`$incontent`/`$inurl` as future)
  - Added flag-as-value guard to extractOpt in llm-context.js + search.js (refactored search.js to use shared extractOpt pattern)
  - Fixed SKILL.md hacker_news comment to say "allow-list" not "boost"

## 2026-02-28

- Added `--goggles` to brave-search `llm-context.js` — passes Brave Goggles re-ranking rules to API
- Added `extra_snippets=true` to `search.js` — 3-5× more context per result, always on
- Deep research on Brave Goggles optimization → `research/brave-goggles-optimization.md`
  - Analyzed official Brave docs, HN threads (31837986, 32599269, 39013497), Reddit discussions
  - Cross-referenced Kagi most-blocked domains, Bobby Hiltz "16 Companies" SEO list, Super-SEO-Spam-Suppressor, Brave's copycats_removal.goggle
  - Key findings: `$discard` + `$boost=1` allow-list pattern, advanced syntax (wildcards, anchors, caret), URL length limits for inline goggles, comprehensive SEO spam domain list
- Accuracy review of goggles research + SKILL.md — verified all hosted goggle URLs (7/7 live), counted actual rules vs claimed:
  - Fixed: tech_blogs 1,465→1,295, banana-boost 7,835→7,468, hacker_news ~3,000→6,238
  - Removed `$intitle`/`$inurl`/`$incontent`/`$lang` from docs — all unimplemented (official quickstart says "future", zero goggles use them)
  - Fixed domain categorization: w3schools/geeksforgeeks/etc are NOT in copycats_removal.goggle (which targets translation scrapers), relabeled as "SEO tutorial farms"
- Discovered hosted goggle URLs silently ignored by LLM Context API (`goggles_id` only works on web search API)
  - All hosted goggle examples in SKILL.md were non-functional — agent thought filtering was applied but it wasn't
- Added `--preset` flag to `llm-context.js`: `code`, `research`, `docs` — inline rules baked into code
  - Tested all 3: code removes SEO farms, research boosts arxiv, docs allow-lists official sources only
- Added `--goggles` to `search.js` with proper `goggles_id` for hosted URLs + inline `goggles` for rules
- llm-context.js now errors on hosted URLs instead of silently ignoring
- Rewrote SKILL.md: 250→90 lines, decision-tree structure, presets front and center
- Moved goggles syntax, hosted goggle catalog, domain lists → `goggles-reference.md`
- CORRECTION: hosted goggles DO work with LLM Context API — earlier test used wrong param name
  - LLM Context API uses `goggles` param for BOTH inline rules and hosted URLs
  - Web Search API uses `goggles` for inline, `goggles_id` for hosted URLs
  - My earlier test used `goggles_id` on LLM Context (wrong), concluded hosted URLs broken
  - Verified with POST body, GET with delays, proper param name — all work
  - Reverted the error message, updated docs to reflect both tools support hosted goggles
- Rewrote SKILL.md goggles section: full syntax reference, task-specific recipes, known spam domain lists, decision guidance for when to apply goggles
- Distilled HN thread "Leaving Google has actively improved my life" (47184288) → `research/hn-leaving-google-improved-life.md`
- Researched Brave vs Kagi vs Google search APIs for agent and personal use → `research/search-api-comparison-brave-kagi-google.md`
  - Key finding: Brave is optimal for agent use (only independent Western index with public API after Bing API died Aug 2025)
  - Google Custom Search API closed to new customers, sunset Jan 2027
  - Kagi API invite-only, beta, 5× more expensive
  - Current brave-search skill was missing the LLM Context endpoint
- Built `llm-context.js` for brave-search skill — single API call for search + pre-extracted LLM-optimized content
  - Replaces the `search.js --content` + `content.js` multi-step pattern for agent use
  - Same price ($5/1k), better extraction, fewer calls, no bot-wall issues
- Updated brave-search SKILL.md with LLM Context docs, corrected pricing/setup info

## 2026-03-01
- Distilled HN thread 47212355: "If AI writes code, should the session be part of the commit?"
  - git-memento tool (git notes for AI sessions), 138 comments, 119 points
  - Key finding: overwhelming rejection of raw sessions, emerging consensus around structured intent capture (CIRs, spec files, plan docs)
  - Notable: dang's meta-comment about Show HN drowning in AI-generated submissions
  - Saved to `research/hn-ai-session-commits.md`, linked from `topics/coding-agents.md`

## 2026-03-02
- Deep verification pass on `research/clojure-ai-agent-coding.md` (v3)
  - Verified all major claims against primary sources: Mündler PLDI 2025, FPEval, ChopChop, Willig report, Nubank blogs
  - **New sources added:**
    - Felix Barbalet "Simple Made Inevitable" (Feb 19, 2026) — strongest pro-Clojure argument, token efficiency data from Rosetta Code
    - GitHub Blog "Why AI is pushing developers toward typed languages" (Jan 2026) — high-credibility pro-types evidence
    - Nubank Feb 2026 blog (Clojure South) — Marlon explicitly positions Clojure as orchestration layer
    - serefayar's Substack (Jan 2026) — agent engine from scratch in Clojure
    - State of Clojure 2025 Survey — notable: AI not mentioned as adoption driver
    - lobste.rs discussion of Barbalet piece — sharp counter-arguments
  - **Corrections:**
    - ChopChop: arxiv 2025 → POPL 2026 (stronger venue)
    - Mycelium date: Mar → Feb 25, 2026
    - Freshcode: Jan 2026 → Dec 31, 2025
    - Nubank: two separate blog posts conflated, now properly attributed
    - druchan explicitly places Clojure Spec in "far less" category
  - **New argument engaged:** brownfield barrier thesis (maintainability > generation quality). Compelling but unfalsifiable at present.
  - **Verdict slightly adjusted:** C→C+ practical readiness (MCP ecosystem growth), added third question about long-term maintainability
  - Key takeaway: dynamic typing remains the critical structural weakness. Best pro-Clojure argument now is about the future, not the present.

## 2026-03-04
- Assessed QMD feasibility on this machine (i3-1000NG4, 8GB RAM, Intel Iris Plus)
  - BM25 mode would work fine; hybrid pipeline (3 GGUF models on CPU, no Metal) would be 30-60s+ per query — borderline unusable
- Researched and compiled comprehensive modern CLI tools tally
  - 100+ tools across 16 categories, community consensus tiers, Yazelix terminal IDE pattern
  - Sources: GitHub awesome lists, Reddit r/rust polls, curated blogs, dotfiles repos (2024-2026)
  - Saved to `research/modern-cli-tools-tally.md`, linked from `topics/dev-tools.md`
- Installed agent-useful tools: `tokei`, `scc`, `ast-grep` (code metrics + structural search)
- Installed human-UX tools: `bat`, `eza`, `git-delta`, `dust`
  - delta was already configured in `.gitconfig` (side-by-side, navigate, line-numbers)
  - Updated `.zshrc`: `cat→bat`, `ls→eza`, `ll→eza -la`, `tree→eza --tree`, `treed→eza -TD`

## 2026-03-03
- **Critical review of `research/distributed-systems-parallel-agents.md`**
  - Verified claims against primary sources (Dria mem-agent blog, USL literature, CAP theorem critiques, saga pattern definitions)
  - **5 issues found and corrected:**
    1. NERDs "paper" doesn't exist — it's tdaltonc's HN comment concept, not a published paper. Fixed in both this file and the source HN distillation.
    2. mem-agent claim ("outperforms GPT-5 and Claude Opus") was misleading — added caveats about self-benchmarking, Qwen3 prompt optimization, Claude Opus 4.1 scaffold incompatibility.
    3. CAP theorem analog was presented as direct mapping — added Kleppmann critique, voluntary vs involuntary isolation distinction, PACELC suggestion.
    4. Saga pattern was overapplied — qualified that FD lifecycle is a state machine, not a saga (no distributed transactions, no compensating rollbacks).
    5. USL applied to human cognition was presented as literal — reframed as metaphorical, noted Miller's Law as better explanation.
  - **Strengths confirmed:** Section 7 (event sourcing/state taxonomy) is genuinely insightful and original. Sections 1, 5, 8 are well-grounded.
- Optimized global AGENTS.md `## CLI Tool Use` section against three research files:
  - `cli-tools-context-efficiency.md`, `agent-tool-use-self-review.md`, `expert-cli-tricks-for-context-saving.md`
  - Added: explicit motivation (trajectory snowball, early-turn cost multiplier), decision ladder (don't read → minimum → fully), operation-oriented structure with sub-decisions (extract section: pattern → `rg -A N`, line numbers → `sed -n`, exploring → `read`), `rg -n` vs `rg -l` guidance, output discipline (head for discovery, `2>&1 | tail` for errors, git shortcuts), quoting safety
  - Kept: all existing patterns (comm, jq -e, awk, rg -F, --, stat, ls -t)
  - Removed: nothing — restructured flat list into 4 logical subsections (motivation, ladder, operations, output, safety)

## 2026-03-06

- Distilled HN thread "LLMs work best when the user defines their acceptance criteria first" (106pts, 83 comments)
  - Article: 20,171× slower SQLite rewrite (576K LoC Rust), 82K-line disk daemon that should be a cron one-liner
  - Key thread insight: pornel's compounding-code dynamic (LLMs add code, never delete), "skill issue" defense is unfalsifiable tautology
  - Saved: `research/hn-llm-plausible-code.md`
- Deep research: why "write minimal code" instructions don't fix LLM code bloat
  - People DO try (r/ClaudeAI thread, 33 upvotes, KISS/YAGNI in CLAUDE.md)
  - Five structural reasons it can't fully work: RLHF length bias in weights, no stop-and-think mechanism, curse of instructions, statelessness, "minimal" requires domain judgment
  - What works: plan-then-execute, TDD, post-hoc cleanup, architectural constraints, active interruption
  - Saved: `research/llm-code-bloat-minimality-instructions.md`
- Critical review of `workflow-minimal-composable-systems.md` — section-by-section agent comprehension audit
  - Added `(HUMAN)` reading instruction: agent should prompt human on these items, not skip silently
  - Resolved duplication tension: Metz "tolerate duplication" (Build) vs "cleanup duplicates" (Verify) — clarified as temporal (tolerate early, consolidate at 2+ use cases)
  - Withdrew suggestions: strip quotes (they're structural constraints via pattern-matching, not decoration), add thresholds (task-relative judgment from quotes + periodic `wc -l`), separate cognitive load for human vs agent (converges on same recommendations)
  - Key insight: quotes induce minimality behavior structurally; "structural constraint beats behavioral instruction" applies to the document itself
