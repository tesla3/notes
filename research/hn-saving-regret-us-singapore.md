## HN Thread Distillation: "America vs. Singapore: You can't save your way out of economic shocks"

**Source:** [governance.fyi](https://www.governance.fyi/p/america-vs-singapore-you-cant-save) summarizing [Rohwedder, Hurd & Börsch-Supan (NBER WP 34835)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w34835) | [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074389) · 305 pts · 459 comments

**Article summary:** A new NBER paper surveys 60–74 year-olds in the US and Singapore and finds that procrastination does not predict saving regret — economic shocks do. 54% of Americans vs 45% of Singaporeans wish they'd saved more, but the gap vanishes among those who experienced zero shocks (42% vs 40%). Singapore's CPF system, re-employment mandates, and MediSave absorb shocks before they compound; the US system lets a job loss simultaneously eliminate income, health insurance, and retirement savings. Probability numeracy (understanding risk) protects against regret; financial literacy does not.

### Dominant Sentiment: Insider corrections drowning out the thesis

The thread barely engages with the paper's central finding — that procrastination is irrelevant and shocks are deterministic. Instead, it splits into two parallel conversations: (1) Singaporean insiders explaining what CPF actually is, and (2) Americans arguing about whether the US safety net is fixable, already good enough, or ideologically doomed. The article's strongest claim — that behavioral nudges treat a symptom while uninsured systemic risk is the disease — gets almost no direct engagement.

### Key Insights

**1. The CPF-as-stealth-tax reframe is the thread's real contribution**

The top comment by [InkCanon] reframes Singapore's CPF not as a shock absorber but as "a massive forced bond purchase scheme" — citizens buy long-term government bonds at below-market rates (~2.6%), funding a sovereign wealth fund that earns the delta. This is the most substantive pushback on the article and it lands: the article treats CPF as wise institutional design, but the mechanism is closer to financial repression. [gruez] names the concept explicitly, linking to the Wikipedia article on financial repression. [everforward] extends it: "It's essentially a forced loan to the government at subpar rates. The 'tax' is the delta between what the government pays out for the bonds vs what a bond of equivalent risk in the free market would have paid."

But the thread then overcorrects. [eru], who lives in Singapore, notes that "you can actually invest your CPF by yourself, and most people do worse" — meaning the below-market return is a ceiling most individuals can't beat anyway. [initramfs2] points out CPF rates actually exceed Singapore government T-bill rates. The "stealth tax" framing is technically correct but practically misleading: most people aren't choosing between CPF and superior alternatives; they're choosing between CPF and nothing.

**2. Singapore's immigrant labor structure is a hidden subsidy the paper ignores**

[mothballed] raises the sharpest structural critique: Singapore has ~25% non-resident workers who pay into the system but are ineligible for public housing and get deported when unemployed. They can't be polled about saving regret because they're gone. [paxys] quantifies the difference: temporary visa workers are ~1% of the US labor force vs a massive share in Singapore. [zorked] generalizes: "Ex-Europe foreigners contribute to, for example, unemployment insurance, but are generally not able to use it because they get their work licenses revoked if they become unemployed."

This is a genuine confound the paper doesn't address. Singapore's shock statistics look better partly because the people who absorb the worst shocks — sudden job loss with forced departure — are excluded from the survey population by design.

**3. The FIRE/saver crowd reveals the article's blind spot about who it's actually for**

A striking sub-thread develops around people who save compulsively and can't figure out what to spend money on. [al_borland]: "On several occasions I've gotten a bonus and decided I should recklessly spend a certain percentage of it. It's hard, because there is nothing I want." [mathgladiator]: "I retired on my 40th birthday... no one has anything that I want to buy." [tombert]: "I'm a simple man, and a part of me just enjoys seeing the line go up."

These comments are unwittingly proving the paper's thesis while thinking they're refuting it. The paper's finding is that saving regret is driven by shocks, not temperament — meaning high savers who also experienced no shocks would feel fine regardless. These commenters are the zero-shock, high-income cohort. They're not counterexamples; they're the control group.

**4. The health insurance compounding mechanism is underdiscussed despite being the paper's most damning finding**

The article's starkest data point — a health spending shock produces 24 percentage points more regret in the US vs 10 in Singapore, despite equal incidence — barely registers in the thread. [supertrope] delivers a dense critique of US healthcare incentives ("fee for service encourages more medical intervention... each layer and sub-sector is for-profit") but nobody connects it back to the paper's core mechanism: employer-tied health insurance means a job loss *causes* a health coverage loss, turning two independent risks into a correlated cascade. The American system doesn't just fail to absorb shocks — it manufactures shock correlations.

[bubblewand] comes closest: "if you follow the fairly common path of 'various expensive, intermittent medical problems for a couple decades'... you're just temporarily taking care of the medical and end-of-life-care industries' money." The paper shows this isn't hyperbole — it's the median American experience.

**5. The cultural-savings counterargument gets cleanly demolished within the thread itself**

[rayiner] offers the strongest methodological challenge: savings behavior is culturally rooted, correlated with origin countries even among third-generation immigrants. [dexwiz] extends this with Chen's "Future Time Reference" linguistic hypothesis (Chinese lacks European-style future tense → less temporal discounting → more saving). Then [rudolftheone] delivers the kill shot: Chen himself co-authored a follow-up that controlled for cultural phylogeny and found the correlation disappeared entirely. "Cultural history drives both the language we speak and our saving habits, rather than the grammar causing the behavior." [dexwiz] gracefully accepts: "I am always hesitant to believe things that sound too Gladwellian."

This is one of those rare HN sub-threads where the community self-corrects in real time. The cultural argument still has force — the paper does compare two very different societies — but the linguistic version is dead.

**6. The retirement-age debate reveals a philosophical chasm HN can't bridge**

[foxyv] asks "Why does the government get to decide when we retire?" and gets at least five incompatible answers: social contract theory ([jcranmer]: "The government decides when it is willing to pay you to be retired"), might-makes-right realism ([jonahx]), duty-based framing ([ecshafer]: "Your duty as a citizen is to work and build your nation"), pragmatic consequentialism ([coldtea]: "many societies have seen what happens when it's left to individuals"), and libertarian rejection ([foxyv] again: "This isn't something the government gives you. It is something they have confiscated"). Nobody persuades anyone. The exchange reveals that the policy debate around forced savings vs voluntary savings is downstream of a values disagreement that data can't resolve.

**7. The US safety net debate circles a paradox nobody names**

[arolihas]: "Like half of our budget goes to welfare." [Herring]: "The US spends by far the most on healthcare per capita, and still gets the worst outcomes." [danny_codes]: "If you are bottom quintile, maybe bottom 2, you are poorer now than 40 years ago." These are all simultaneously true. The US spends enormous sums on social insurance and gets terrible results — not because the spending is insufficient but because the spending is structured to flow through intermediaries (employers, insurance companies, state-level bureaucracies) who capture rents at every layer. The paper's finding that identical shocks produce wildly different financial scars isn't about spending levels; it's about plumbing.

### Common Pushbacks

| Pushback | Quality | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| CPF is financial repression, not a safety net | Strong | Technically correct but practically misleading — most citizens can't beat CPF returns anyway |
| Singapore exports its worst shocks via immigrant deportation | Strong | Genuine survey confound the paper doesn't address |
| Savings behavior is culturally rooted | Medium | Valid concern about comparability, but the linguistic version was debunked in-thread |
| The study ignores people who saved too much and died early | Weak | Survivorship bias is real but [3rodents] correctly notes compulsive savers get utility from the nest egg itself |
| You can't compare a city-state to a continental power | Medium | Scale matters for policy transfer, but the paper's core finding (shocks > procrastination) is about mechanism, not prescription |
| Singapore is a dictatorship wearing democracy's outfit | Misapplied | True as political critique, irrelevant to the paper's empirical claims about shock absorption |

### What the Thread Misses

- **The probability numeracy finding is potentially more important than the shock finding.** If understanding risk is the strongest individual-level predictor of saving satisfaction — stronger than financial literacy, stronger than wealth quartile in Singapore — that implies the problem isn't just institutional but epistemological. People who understand that bad things happen prepare differently. This is barely discussed.

- **The article's framing experiment (asking "spend less and save more" vs just "save more" reduces regret by ~7 points) suggests that saving regret itself is partly a measurement artifact.** The thread treats the 54% figure as gospel.

- **Nobody asks whether Singapore's model is exportable to countries that can't deport their shock-absorbers.** The immigrant labor cushion isn't just a confound — it's load-bearing.

- **The compounding shock data (US regret climbs to 76% at 5+ shocks; Singapore stays flat at ~50%) implies Singapore's system has a nonlinear advantage** — it doesn't just reduce individual shocks, it prevents cascading. Nobody explores what architectural feature produces this.

### Verdict

The paper's core finding — that procrastination doesn't predict saving regret but economic shocks do — is robust and important. But the thread exposes something the article elides: Singapore's "better institutional design" rests partly on financial repression (forced below-market-rate loans to the government) and partly on externalizing shocks onto a non-citizen labor force that can be expelled during downturns. These aren't incidental features; they're structural. The honest conclusion isn't "Singapore proves institutions matter" — it's that every society chooses who absorbs the shocks, and the only question is whether that choice is visible. America's choice is unusually cruel because it's dressed up as individual responsibility. Singapore's is unusually effective because the people who bear the worst costs can't vote and can't be surveyed.
