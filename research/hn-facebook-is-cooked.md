# HN Thread Distillation: "Facebook is cooked"

**Source:** [HN thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091748) (843 points, 494 comments, 241+ unique authors) · [Article](https://pilk.website/3/facebook-is-absolutely-cooked) · 2026-02-20

**Article summary:** The author logged into Facebook for the first time in ~8 years, found a feed dominated by AI-generated thirst traps, engagement bait, and zero content from friends. Concludes Facebook is "cooked." Screenshots provided.

**Article critique:** The article's evidence directly undermines its thesis. The author acknowledges the dormant account ("I hadn't logged in in nearly a decade!") and even asks "is this just something wacky with my algorithm?" — then ignores their own question and generalizes to the entire platform. The screenshots show what a recommendation algorithm serves an unknown male user with no engagement history. This is a data point about the algorithm's default, not about the platform's health.

## Dominant Sentiment: Cathartic pile-on with weak foundations

A large, energetic thread where everyone gets to share their own "Facebook is garbage" story. But the signal-to-noise ratio is poor — the most upvoted comments are either "same here" confirmations from similarly dormant users, or active users politely explaining the cold-start problem. The thread is more therapy session than analysis.

## Key Insights

### 1. The article reveals the algorithm's Bayesian prior, not Facebook's decline

The thread's sharpest observers converge on this: what the author saw is the cold-start problem. [PaulHoule]: *"Anything like that faces a 'cold start' problem when they don't have data about you."* [paxys] logged in and found friend content starting at post #1, with the first non-friend post at #14. [goatsi]: *"With a long dormant account, facebook has no real content to show you. Your friends will almost all be dormant as well."*

But what nobody explicitly states is what the default *means*. If the algorithm's fallback for an unknown male profile is wall-to-wall AI thirst traps, that's because across all male users with weak signal profiles, thirst traps generate the most engagement. The default isn't random — it's the population-level optimal strategy for the demographic. The author didn't discover that Facebook is broken; they discovered what the median disengaged male user responds to. That's a more uncomfortable finding than "Facebook is cooked."

### 2. The "cooked" thesis is directly falsified by data nobody wants to hear

[Aurornis] is the thread's most useful commenter, citing [Pew Research](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/): 71% of US adults reported using Facebook in 2025 — up from 68% in 2023, and higher among 30-49 year-olds than 50+. This flatly contradicts the article's "everyone under 50 has moved on." [AnotherGoodName] adds: *"When Meta stock went to ~$90 in late 2022 we had non-stop 'Facebook is dead I don't know anyone that uses it lol' posts. The stock is ~$650 today. We are not the target audience."*

The thread's dominant narrative — that Facebook is dying — runs against every available metric. The HN demographic's disengagement is real but not generalizable. This is textbook [Pauline Kael fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Kael#Apocryphal_quote): "Nobody I know uses Facebook" tells you about your social circle, not about Facebook. [dash2] calls it explicitly: *"This is the tech version of 'nobody I know voted for Nixon.'"*

### 3. Facebook has bifurcated into two different products wearing the same skin

The thread inadvertently maps Facebook's split personality:

**Product A (Utility):** Marketplace, Groups, Messenger, event coordination. Nearly every commenter who still uses Facebook mentions one of these. [r0m4n0]: *"You can buy literally anything on marketplace for a fraction of the price new."* [MaintenanceMode] describes how entire sailing communities coordinate exclusively through Facebook Groups. [com2kid]: *"Offer up is dead in my area. Craigslist is a joke. Everything happens on FB marketplace."*

**Product B (Engagement farm):** The News Feed, Reels, Suggested content. This is where the slop lives. The two products coexist because Product A gives users a reason to open the app, and Product B is what they see when they do.

The dynamic nobody names: **Facebook has become the AOL of social media** — a decreasingly-relevant portal wrapped around genuinely useful utility services (Marketplace ≈ classified ads, Groups ≈ forums, Messenger ≈ email). The feed exists to serve ads between utility visits, not to be a product in itself.

### 4. The gendered algorithm claim is strong but overstated

[jedberg] makes the thread's boldest claim: *"Once Meta identifies you as male, you will get almost exclusively thirst trap posts no matter what you do."* They report that even a sustained campaign of liking only pottery and parenting content reverted within a week. A woman who created a test male account reportedly saw the same thing.

But this is contradicted by multiple male users in the same thread. [munificent] scrolled 30 posts with zero thirst content. [rconti]: *"I've been a male for all 22 years I've been using Facebook. I don't get that stuff."* [the_af]: no thirst traps, *"most of my feed is relevant to my interests."* [sgt], active since 2006: no spam at all.

The actual pattern seems to be: **male + dormant/low-engagement = thirst traps. Male + active + curated = normal feed.** The gender is a factor, but engagement history is the stronger signal. [jedberg]'s experience may reflect someone who interacts enough to be classified as active but not enough to override the demographic default — a middle ground the algorithm handles poorly.

### 5. Adverse selection as business strategy

[hedayet] contributes the thread's most structurally interesting insight: *"Facebook may actually do better as a business as high-resistance users leave (for the same reason spammers keep their messages intentionally faulty). Churn effectively acts as a filtering mechanism... What looks like decline from the outside may just be the system converging on the segment it extracts the most value from."*

This inverts the "Facebook is dying" narrative entirely. If sophisticated users who resist engagement leave, and unsophisticated users who engage with slop stay, the platform's revenue-per-user *increases* even as "quality" decreases. This is the dynamic version of [lich_king]'s observation: *"the platform is not broken. It's delivering people precisely what they want."* The product isn't degrading — it's specializing.

### 6. "Train your algorithm" is a confession, not a defense

Dozens of commenters offer some variant of "you just need to curate your feed" — block accounts, click "show less," interact with content you like, use the Friends tab. [MiddleEndian] "aggressively blocks anything even mildly annoying." [InMice] bookmarks the Feeds page because Facebook keeps burying it.

The thread treats this as a defense of the platform. It's actually an indictment. **No previous communication medium required this much defensive labor from the user.** The default state of the product is hostile; the user must fight to extract value. The people with "good" Facebook experiences are survivorship bias — they're the ones who tolerated the training period. Everyone else left and is now writing blog posts about how Facebook is cooked.

### 7. The international angle complicates every take

[dash2]: *"In the Philippines, Facebook IS the internet. Every business runs on it."* [nathanaldensr] confirms. [testing22321]: *"I spent time in 35 countries in Africa. FB is the internet."* Phone plans in some countries include free data specifically for Facebook/Messenger.

The thread's "Facebook is dead" consensus is parochial. In large parts of the world, Facebook isn't a social media platform — it's infrastructure. This doesn't make the slop problem less real, but it means the "just stop using it" response is only available to people with alternatives. The platform's worst content optimization is being applied to populations with the least ability to leave.

## Common Pushbacks

| Pushback | Quality | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| "You haven't used it in 8 years, of course it's bad" | Strong | The cold-start explanation is well-evidenced and directly explains the article's experience. |
| "My feed is fine, you just need to curate it" | Medium | True for those who invest the effort, but normalizes a product that defaults to hostility. |
| "Nobody uses Facebook anymore" | Weak | Directly contradicted by Pew (71% of US adults, 2025) and Meta's financials. |
| "Facebook is making money so it's fine" | Misapplied | Revenue health doesn't address the content quality problem or the question of social harm. Confuses business success with product quality. |
| "It's just what the algorithm shows males" | Medium | Gender is a factor but engagement history dominates. Multiple active male users report clean feeds. |

## What the Thread Misses

- **The ad side of the slop equation.** [kmfrk] mentions Meta allotting 5% of ad spend for AI-generated creative testing — meaning advertisers' own promotions are being turned into AI slop by Meta, not just organic content. Nobody follows up on this, but it suggests the AI content problem extends beyond user-generated posts into the ad inventory itself.
- **The content moderation collapse.** [operatingthetan] asks *"FB used to be the absolute best at getting rid of spam and now they appear to be overcome by it?"* and nobody answers. Meta gutted its content moderation teams starting in late 2024, and this thread is documenting the consequences without connecting them to the cause.
- **The Marketplace lock-in trap.** Nearly every "I still use Facebook" comment mentions Marketplace. Nobody asks why Meta hasn't spun Marketplace into its own app — the answer is obvious (it's the last funnel into the engagement farm), but the coercive design deserves explicit naming. The planned shutdown of messenger.com to force users back to facebook.com, mentioned by [jhaile] and [umby], is the same pattern.
- **The children problem.** The article ends with seeing AI images of girls who "looked like they were about ~14" and nobody in the thread engages with this. [da02] mentions schools using Facebook and the implications for minors, but it's a lone voice. The intersection of AI-generated content, sexualized defaults, and minor exposure is the most serious issue here and gets the least discussion.
- **What "engagement" actually measures.** Everyone uses the word but nobody interrogates it. The slot-machine scroll, the "I accidentally looked at something and now my feed changed" reports from multiple commenters — this isn't engagement in any meaningful sense. It's behavioral exploitation being measured as a business metric.

## Deep Dive: Adverse Selection as Platform Dynamics

[hedayet]'s comment deserves more than a paragraph. The full claim:

> *"A counter-intuitive take: Facebook may actually do better as a business as high-resistance users leave (for the same reason spammers keep their messages intentionally faulty). From an optimization standpoint, knowledgable, hard-to-rile-up users are mostly noise. As they churn, the remaining user base becomes more homogeneous and easier to optimize for engagement and ads. Churn effectively acts as a filtering mechanism. So what looks like decline from the outside may just be the system converging on the segment it extracts the most value from. From Facebook's perspective, that's not collapse - it's specialization."*

### The spammer analogy — what it gets right

The Nigerian prince comparison is precise. Cormac Herley's 2012 Microsoft Research paper formalized this: scammers use absurd stories and bad grammar *deliberately* as a pre-screening filter. Anyone who replies past obvious red flags is pre-qualified as gullible, making time-per-conversion plummet. The terrible quality isn't a bug — it's qualification.

hedayet maps this to Facebook's content: AI slop and thirst traps function as a filter. Users repelled by it leave. Users who engage stay. The remaining population is cheaper to serve (responds to low-effort content), more predictable (uniform engagement patterns), and more monetizable (clicks ads, scrolls longer). The mechanism is correct. The question is whether it produces a stable equilibrium or a death spiral.

### The ML homogeneity argument

hedayet's subtlest point: a more homogeneous user base is easier to optimize for. This is genuinely true from a recommendation systems perspective. When users have wildly different engagement patterns — some want friend updates, some want news, some resist all algorithmic content — the model degrades because it's serving too many distributions simultaneously. If the hardest-to-serve users self-select out, average model performance *improves* on the remaining population. Accuracy-per-dollar of ML infrastructure goes up.

Meta's financials support this indirectly. Ad impressions and price-per-ad have both increased steadily even as "quality" users complain about degradation. The system is getting better at converting remaining users into ad revenue.

### Where the analogy breaks

The spammer analogy has a critical limitation: **scammers don't need network effects.** A scammer targeting the gullible 0.1% works fine because each victim is independent. Facebook's value depends on *who else is on the platform*. Three failure modes hedayet's model doesn't account for:

**Advertiser CPM collapse.** Advertisers don't pay per eyeball uniformly — they pay based on the *value* of the eyeball. A feed full of low-income, older, less-educated users commands far lower CPMs than one with affluent 25-45 year-old professionals. Meta's ARPU in Asia-Pacific (~$4/user/quarter) is roughly a tenth of North America (~$40). If "specialization" means convergence toward low-CPM demographics, revenue-per-user falls even as engagement-per-user rises. The optimization target (engagement) and the revenue driver (advertiser willingness to pay) can diverge.

**Network effect inversion.** hedayet's model treats departure as a one-time filter. But network effects work in reverse. When quality user A leaves, the platform becomes less valuable for quality user B. B's departure degrades it for C. This is non-linear — the degradation accelerates. MySpace, Yahoo, and AOL all experienced this: what looked like "specialization" into a stable niche (bands, finance/email, dial-up holdouts) was slow-motion collapse where the "stable" remaining population depended on the departed population in ways not obvious until they were gone.

**Utility feature dependency.** The thread reveals most remaining engaged users rely on Marketplace, Groups, or Messenger — not the Feed. These have their own network effects (Marketplace needs buyers *and* sellers). If Marketplace users experience enough slop friction to explore alternatives, the utility moat cracks. The "specialized" engagement-farm users don't sustain Marketplace; the Marketplace users sustain the engagement farm by providing a reason to open the app. The dependency runs the wrong direction for hedayet's model.

### Is there a stable floor?

Arguments for convergence on a stable population:
- Developing-world infrastructure dependency (Philippines, Africa — Facebook *is* the internet)
- Marketplace monopoly in local classifieds (no viable alternative in many areas)
- Older demographics with high switching costs
- Niche Groups that can't easily migrate (sailing communities, local buy-nothing, specific hobbies)

Arguments against a floor:
- WhatsApp and Instagram carry communication and photo-sharing independently — the Facebook app specifically becomes dispensable
- Marketplace could be cloned by anyone with distribution
- Per Pew, 30-49 usage exceeds 50+ — the "old people only" narrative is wrong, meaning the platform isn't converging on an age-defined niche. The *HN-adjacent tech demographic* left, not "young people"

### The generalized version

Where hedayet's framing is most powerful is at the level above individual platforms: **every ad-funded, engagement-optimized platform will eventually undergo this adverse selection.** The engagement loop selects for the most manipulable users, which degrades the environment for resistant users, who leave, which further concentrates the manipulable population. This isn't Facebook-specific — it's a structural property of engagement-maximizing systems.

YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and X are all on the same curve at different points. The variable is how fast each burns through resistant users, which depends on how aggressively it optimizes for engagement versus how much non-engagement utility (search, commerce, professional networking) gives resistant users a reason to stay.

Facebook may be furthest along this curve because it's oldest and has the weakest remaining utility moat (compared to YouTube's video library or LinkedIn's professional identity). But the insight generalizes: **the degradation isn't dysfunction — it's the system reaching its engagement-maximizing fixed point, which is a local optimum for revenue and a global minimum for user welfare.**

The counter-intuitive corollary: the platforms that degrade *slowest* aren't the ones with the best content moderation — they're the ones with the strongest non-engagement utility that keeps resistant users present despite the slop, maintaining demographic diversity and higher CPMs. The moment utility features become replaceable, adverse selection accelerates.

## Verdict

The article asks "is Facebook cooked?" The answer is no — not in the way the author means. Facebook isn't dying; it's 71% of US adults and printing money. What's actually happening is more interesting and more troubling: **Facebook has completed its transition from social network to engagement utility, and the default experience for anyone who isn't actively fighting the algorithm is optimized slop.** The thread circles this without stating it — dozens of active users explain how their feeds are fine *because they put in the work*, while dormant users describe a dystopia. Both are describing the same product. The dystopia is the product. The "good" feed is what you get when you labor to override it. The real question isn't whether Facebook is cooked — it's what it means that a platform used by 3 billion people defaults to AI thirst traps for half the population and considers that a feature, not a bug.
