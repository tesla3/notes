## PRS T20 Placement: Two Estimates

**FindingSchool figures (2021–2024, apples-to-apples methodology):**

| Metric | PRS |
|---|---|
| HYPSM | 0.89% |
| T25 | 1.79% |
| T50 | 2.23% |

**Hand-count from PRS's own 4-year matriculation list (2022–2025, 446 grads):**

Schools use an asterisk (\*) to indicate 2+ students. No MIT, Caltech, Northwestern, Dartmouth, or UChicago appear at all.

| T20 School | Indicator | Min. Students |
|---|---|---|
| Harvard | \* | 2 |
| Stanford | \* | 2 |
| Columbia | \* | 2 |
| Cornell | \* | 2 |
| Johns Hopkins | \* | 2 |
| UCLA | \* | 2 |
| UC Berkeley | \* | 2 |
| Vanderbilt | \* | 2 |
| Princeton | (no \*) | 1 |
| Yale | (no \*) | 1 |
| Brown | (no \*) | 1 |
| UPenn | (no \*) | 1 |
| Duke | (no \*) | 1 |
| Rice | (no \*) | 1 |

**Conservative T20 total: 22 / 446 = ~5%** (assuming each \* = exactly 2)
**Moderate estimate: 30–37 / 446 = ~7–8%** (assuming \* averages ~3)

The FindingSchool T25 figure of 1.79% appears to use a narrower methodology than a straightforward headcount. The hand-count suggests T20 placement is likely **5–8%**, not ~2%. But even at 8%, PRS significantly trails its peers.

## Head-to-Head: San Diego Private School Peers

### FindingSchool Metrics (Consistent Methodology)

| School | Tuition | HYPSM | T25 | T50 | FS Rating |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bishop's** | ~$47K | **11.72%** | **18.75%** | 18.75% | A+ |
| **Francis Parker** | ~$44K | 2.88% | **16.55%** | 21.58% | A |
| **La Jolla Country Day** | ~$44K | 2.48% | 11.57% | **23.42%** | A+ |
| **Pacific Ridge** | $45K | **0.89%** | **1.79%** | 2.23% | A- |

### Actual Class-Level Data (Where Available)

**Francis Parker Class of 2024** (139 students):
- 18 students to T20 schools = **12.9%**
- Includes Stanford (3), UC Berkeley (4), UCLA (3), Princeton (1), Dartmouth (1), Cornell (1), UPenn (1), UChicago (1), Rice (1), Georgetown (1), Carnegie Mellon (1)

**LJCDS 3-Year (2023–2025, 356 students):**
- 48+ countable T20 students = **~13.5%+**
- Standouts: UC Berkeley (10), Carnegie Mellon (9), Cornell (7), Stanford (6), Columbia (4), Northwestern (3)
- MIT (2), Harvard (2), Princeton (1), Yale (1) also represented

**Bishop's Class of 2024** (~128 students):
- Princeton (5), Harvard (3), Johns Hopkins (3), MIT (2), UChicago (2), plus Yale, Stanford, Penn, Duke
- HYPSM alone: ~15 students = **~12%**

**PRS (4 years, 446 students):**
- Conservative T20 estimate: 22 students = **~5% total, ~1.2% per year**
- Five T20 schools completely absent (MIT, Caltech, Northwestern, Dartmouth, UChicago)

## The Gap, Quantified

| Metric | Bishop's | Parker | LJCDS | PRS |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HYPSM per year | ~15 students | ~4 students | ~3 students | **~1 student** |
| T20 per year (est.) | ~25+ students | ~18 students | ~16 students | **~5–8 students** |
| T20 rate | ~20%+ | ~13% | ~13% | **~5–8%** |
| Missing T20 schools | 0 | few | few | **5 (MIT, Caltech, Northwestern, Dartmouth, UChicago)** |
| CC matriculations | 0 | 1 (SDCC) | 1 (Southwestern) | **Multiple (MiraCosta\*, Palomar\*)** |

---

## Why the Gap

1. **Selectivity**: PRS acceptance rate is ~90%. Bishop's and Parker are far more selective. You're comparing an open-enrollment school to curated ones.
2. **Age**: PRS (est. 2007) vs. Bishop's (1909) / Parker (1912). Brand recognition with admissions offices takes generations.
3. **AP cap**: PRS limits juniors to 3 APs, seniors to 4. Pedagogically sound but limits course-loading for T10 applicants.
4. **Culture/self-selection**: North County affluent families choosing PRS often prioritize quality of life over Ivy obsession. La Jolla schools draw from San Diego's most education-driven demographic.
5. **STEM gap**: No MIT placements at all. No Caltech. Notable hole.

## Bottom Line

PRS's T20 placement rate is approximately **5–8%** by generous hand-count, or **~2%** by FindingSchool's methodology. Either way, it places **dead last** among its San Diego private school peers — schools that charge comparable tuition (~$44–47K).

- Bishop's sends **3–4x** more students to T20 schools (by rate)
- Bishop's HYPSM rate is **10–13x** higher than PRS
- Parker and LJCDS both send roughly **2x** the T20 rate of PRS

## Data Limitations

- PRS's asterisk-only matriculation format makes precise counting impossible. Ranges are used throughout.
- FindingSchool's T50/T25 percentages for PRS seem low relative to the actual matriculation list; their methodology may exclude certain school types or use limited data windows.
- Bishop's actual per-student matriculation list was not publicly available in text form; figures derived from FindingSchool and partial school profile data.
- "T20" definition varies by ranking year. This analysis uses a broad consensus T20 from US News ~2024.
- PRS is only 18 years old. Track records are still building. Revisit in 5 years.
