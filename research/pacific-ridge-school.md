# Pacific Ridge School (PRS) — Critical Analysis

**Focus: T20 College Placement** | February 2026
**Rev 3** — Recut to T20 using US News 2026 rankings. Added UC Berkeley and UCLA (now ranked #15 and #17); dropped Georgetown, Emory, UVA, USC (all ranked #24+). This shift notably reshuffles peer comparisons because CA schools send heavily to Berkeley/UCLA.

## Executive Summary

Pacific Ridge School is a well-run, young (est. 2007), independent day school in Carlsbad, CA charging $45K/year. It delivers a strong educational experience with genuine pedagogical distinction (Harkness method). Its elite college placement is real but meaningfully lower than its San Diego private school peers — roughly **2–3x below Parker/LJCDS and 3–5x below Bishop's** on T20 placement. Using the 2026 US News T20 (which now includes UC Berkeley #15 and UCLA #17), the comparison actually tightens slightly for PRS because Berkeley/UCLA inclusion helps all CA schools proportionally, while the schools that dropped out of T20 (Georgetown, Emory, UVA, USC) were heavily fed by Bishop's and LJCDS. The gap is overwhelmingly explained by PRS's much lower admissions selectivity (90% acceptance vs. significantly lower at peers), not by instruction quality.

## College Placement: The Corrected Analysis

### Data Sources (with quality assessment)

| School | Source | Format | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bishop's** | Official school profile PDF (2024-25) | Exact student counts per school, 4-year | ★★★★★ Gold standard |
| **Parker** | Official school profile PDF (2024-25) | Exact student counts per school, 4-year | ★★★★★ Gold standard |
| **LJCDS** | School website 3-year matriculation list | Parenthetical counts, 3-year window | ★★★★ Good (different time window) |
| **PRS** | School website 4-year matriculation list | Asterisk (2+) only, no exact counts | ★★☆ Poor — range estimates required |
| ~~FindingSchool~~ | ~~Third-party aggregator~~ | ~~Percentages~~ | ~~★☆ Unreliable — wildly undercounts~~ |

**FindingSchool was the primary source in my original analysis. Cross-checking against school-published data shows it undercounts systematically, especially for schools with less international visibility. I've discarded it entirely.**

### T20 Definition (US News 2026)

Rank ≤20 national universities (23 schools due to ties): Princeton (#1), MIT (#2), Harvard (#3), Stanford (#4), Yale (#4), UChicago (#6), Duke (#7), JHU (#7), Northwestern (#7), UPenn (#7), Caltech (#11), Cornell (#12), Brown (#13), Dartmouth (#13), Columbia (#15), UC Berkeley (#15), Rice (#17), UCLA (#17), Vanderbilt (#17), Carnegie Mellon (#20), Michigan (#20), Notre Dame (#20), WUSTL (#20).

**Key change from T25 (2024 USN):** UC Berkeley and UCLA enter; Georgetown, Emory, UVA, and USC drop out. This reshuffles the peer comparison significantly — see dynamics analysis below.

### The Numbers

| School | Period | Grads | T20 # | T20 % | HYPSM # | HYPSM % | Data quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bishop's** | 4yr (2021–24) | 528 | **158** | **29.9%** | **46** | **8.7%** | Exact counts from PDF |
| **Parker** | 4yr (2021–24) | 526 | **102** | **19.4%** | **18** | **3.4%** | Exact counts from PDF |
| **LJCDS** | 3yr (~2023–25) | ~357 | **64** | **~17.9%** | **12** | **~3.4%** | Counted from website |
| **PRS (floor)** | 4yr (2022–25) | 446 | **29** | **6.5%** | **6** | **1.3%** | * = 2 (minimum) |
| **PRS (mid-est)** | 4yr (2022–25) | 446 | **40** | **9.0%** | **8** | **1.8%** | * = 3 (likely) |

### T25→T20 Shift Dynamics

The switch from T25 (2024 rankings) to T20 (2026 rankings) has uneven effects across schools because of their different UC vs. private school feeding patterns:

| School | Lost (Gtown+Emory+UVA+USC) | Gained (Berkeley+UCLA) | Net | T25% → T20% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bishop's** | −36 (10+4+2+**24**) | +25 (12+13) | **−11** | 32.8% → 29.9% |
| **Parker** | −18 (3+1+2+12) | +36 (**23**+13) | **+18** | 16.0% → 19.4% |
| **LJCDS** | −20 (1+1+1+**17**) | +15 (10+5) | **−5** | 19.3% → 17.9% |
| **PRS (mid)** | −7 (3+1+0+3) | +6 (3+3) | **−1** | 9.2% → 9.0% |

**Key insight:** Parker is the biggest beneficiary because UC Berkeley (23 students) is its single largest T20 feeder — larger than any other school-to-university pipeline except Bishop's→UChicago (23). Bishop's is the biggest loser because its massive USC pipeline (24 students) falls out of T20 entirely.

### What This Actually Shows

**Three tiers remain, with some reshuffling:**

1. **Tier 1 — Bishop's (30% T20, 9% HYPSM):** Still dominant despite losing the USC pipeline from the count. UChicago (23), UCLA (13), Michigan (13), UC Berkeley (12), Harvard (11) are the big feeders. Tuition ~$50K.

2. **Tier 2 — Parker & LJCDS (18–19% T20, 3.4% HYPSM):** Parker pulls slightly ahead of LJCDS under T20 (were basically tied under T25) because of its enormous Berkeley pipeline (23). LJCDS loses more from the USC drop (17) than it gains from UC additions (15). Tuition $40–44K.

3. **Tier 3 — PRS (7–9% T20, 1.3–1.8% HYPSM):** Nearly unchanged from T25 analysis. Roughly half the T20 rate of Tier 2, one-third of Tier 1. Tuition $45K.

**The actual gap is 2–3x vs Parker/LJCDS, and 3–5x vs Bishop's.** PRS sends students to 18 of the 23 T20 schools — the missing five (MIT, Caltech, UChicago, Northwestern, Dartmouth) are all schools that require very specific profiles or don't recruit heavily from San Diego.

### Cross-Check: FindingSchool vs Reality

| School | FindingSchool T25% | Actual T20% (2026) | Error direction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bishop's | 18.75% | 29.9% | **Undercounts massively** |
| Parker | 16.55% | 19.4% | Undercounts |
| LJCDS | 11.57% | 17.9% | **Undercounts significantly** |
| PRS | 1.79% | 6.5–9.0% | **Undercounts catastrophically** |

FindingSchool appears to use incomplete data and a narrow methodology. Its figures are unreliable for any school and catastrophically wrong for PRS. **Any analysis comparing schools using FindingSchool percentages across schools is invalid.**

### Community Colleges — Not a PRS-Specific Issue

My original analysis flagged PRS's CC enrollments as a red flag. This was unfair. The data shows **all four schools** send graduates to community colleges:

| School | CC students (4yr/3yr) | As % of grads |
|---|---|---|
| Bishop's | 3 (Saddleback, Santa Monica, Ventura) | 0.6% |
| Parker | 9 (Grossmont 3, SD City 1, SD Mesa 2, SD Miramar 1, SB City 1, Spokane Falls 1) | 1.7% |
| LJCDS | 2 (SD Miramar, Southwestern) | 0.6% |
| PRS | 7+ (MiraCosta 2+, Palomar 2+, SB City 1, SM College 2+) | 1.6%+ |

Parker sends more students to CCs than PRS does. This is a normal part of any school's distribution, not evidence of failure.

## Why the Gap Exists

The T20 gap between PRS and peers is real. The explanations:

1. **Admissions selectivity (biggest factor).** PRS acceptance rate ~90%. Parker/Bishop's are significantly more selective. Higher selectivity = stronger entering class = better outcomes. This is selection effect, not value-added.

2. **Youth.** PRS was founded in 2007 (first grads 2011). Bishop's: 1909. Parker: 1912. LJCDS: 1926. Admissions officer relationships, alumni networks, and institutional brand take decades to build.

3. **Culture and emphasis.** PRS emphasizes holistic development, ethical responsibility, global engagement. Bishop's phased out APs in favor of even more rigorous Honors/Advanced Honors tracks. Bishop's has 5 college counselors for ~127 seniors; PRS has 4 counselors for ~108 seniors (actually a better ratio).

4. **AP cap.** PRS caps juniors at 3 APs and seniors at 4. Bishop's replaced APs with its own advanced curriculum that is arguably more rigorous. Parker offers 26 APs with no stated cap.

5. **Peer cohort self-selection.** Families who prioritize elite placement disproportionately choose Bishop's and Parker. This concentrates high-achieving, college-obsessed students at those schools. PRS attracts families who prioritize North County convenience and community warmth.

## What PRS Does Well

- **AP scores are legitimately strong** (72% scoring 4–5) — comparable to much more selective peers
- **Harkness pedagogy** is a genuine differentiator, not marketing fluff
- **7:1 ratio** with 15-student classes provides real individual attention
- **Global travel program** with financial aid for trip costs
- **Solid UC pathway**: Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Davis all asterisked
- **Community warmth** is consistently praised in reviews across multiple platforms

## Verdict

**PRS's T20 placement (7–9%) is roughly half that of its closest peers Parker (19%) and LJCDS (18%), and one-third of Bishop's (30%).** The gap is real, consistent across T20/T25 cuts, and worth knowing. PRS is weakest at the very top (HYPSM: 1–2 students per year), and completely absent from five T20 schools (MIT, Caltech, UChicago, Northwestern, Dartmouth).

The gap is overwhelmingly explained by intake selectivity. PRS accepts ~90% of applicants; its peers are far more selective. The question families should ask isn't "which school places better?" but "**what would my kid's outcome be at PRS vs. the alternative?**" — and that depends entirely on the individual student.

**Who PRS makes most sense for:**
- North County families who value proximity (vs. 30–45 min drive to La Jolla)
- Students who would benefit from Harkness-style learning in small classes
- Families who prioritize community and holistic development
- Students aiming for strong UCs, good LACs, or solid private universities

**Who should consider alternatives:**
- Families for whom T20/Ivy placement is the primary goal
- Students who are already very high-performing and would benefit from a more selective peer group

### Ratings (revised)

- College placement: **3/5** (unchanged — the gap is real, just not as extreme)
- Overall educational experience: **4/5**
- Price-to-placement value: **3/5** (revised up from 2.5 — the original rating was based on bad data)

## Methodology Notes

- **Bishop's** data from official school profile PDF (2024-25), extracted via PyMuPDF. Exact student counts per institution, Class of '24 and 4-year (2021-2024) columns. 528 grads over 4 years (~132/year). Gold standard data. Class of 2025 has 127 students.
- **Parker** data from official school profile PDF (2024-25), extracted via PyMuPDF. Exact student counts in parentheses, 4-year (2021-2024). 526 grads over 4 years (~131/year). Class of 2025 has 142 students.
- **LJCDS** data from school website's 3-year matriculation list with parenthetical counts. Time window likely 2023-2025 (page mentions 2025 stats). ~357 estimated grads (~119/year from Class of 2024 count).
- **PRS** data from school website's 4-year list (classes 2022-2025, 446 grads). Uses asterisk (*) = 2+ students format. Floor (all * = 2) and mid-estimate (all * = 3) calculated.
  - **Data discrepancy:** PRS website and PRS school profile PDF (created Oct 2025) show the same time window (2022-2025, 446 grads) but differ on specific schools and asterisks. Website has Duke and Notre Dame; PDF does not. Harvard is asterisked on website but not PDF; Yale is asterisked on PDF but not website. Website appears to be the more current version (post-Class of 2025 finalization). Used website as primary source.
- **T20** defined as US News 2026 top 20 ranked national universities (23 schools due to ties at ranks 4, 7, 13, 15, 17, 20). Prior analysis used US News 2024 T25.
- Adding T15 LACs would increase all schools' numbers roughly proportionally. PRS sends students to Pomona, Scripps, Pitzer, Claremont McKenna, Smith, Colgate, Hamilton, Kenyon, and others.

### Revision History & Corrections

**Rev 1 (original):** Used FindingSchool percentages — later found to understate PRS's rate by 74–81%. Claimed "10–20x" gaps (actual: 2–5x). Singled out PRS's CC enrollments unfairly.

**Rev 2:** Corrected to use school-published data. Recut at T25 (2024 US News). Established the 2–5x gap range with proper sourcing.

**Rev 3 (current):** Recut to T20 using US News 2026 rankings. Key change: UC Berkeley (#15) and UCLA (#17) enter the T20; Georgetown, Emory, UVA, USC drop out. This creates an interesting reshuffling where Parker's rate *increases* (Berkeley is its largest single feeder at 23 students) while Bishop's rate *decreases* (losing USC's 24-student pipeline). PRS is approximately neutral. Added PRS website vs. PDF discrepancy analysis. Updated Bishop's tuition ($50K) and LJCDS time window.
