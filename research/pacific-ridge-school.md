# Pacific Ridge School (PRS) — Critical Analysis

**Focus: College Placement** | February 2026
**Rev 2** — Corrected with primary-source data. Original analysis used unreliable FindingSchool percentages; this revision uses school-published matriculation data with exact counts where available.

---

## Executive Summary

Pacific Ridge School is a well-run, young (est. 2007), independent day school in Carlsbad, CA charging $45K/year. It delivers a strong educational experience with genuine pedagogical distinction (Harkness method). Its elite college placement is real but meaningfully lower than its San Diego private school peers — roughly **2–3x below Parker and LJCDS, and 4–5x below Bishop's** on T25 placement. This is primarily explained by PRS's much lower admissions selectivity (90% acceptance vs. significantly lower at peers), not by instruction quality (AP scores are strong). Families choosing PRS should understand they're paying for the holistic experience and North County convenience, not maximizing elite placement odds.

## College Placement: The Corrected Analysis

### Data Sources (with quality assessment)

| School | Source | Format | Quality |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bishop's** | Official school profile PDF (2024-25) | Exact student counts per school, 4-year | ★★★★★ Gold standard |
| **Parker** | Official school profile PDF (2024-25) | Exact student counts per school, 4-year | ★★★★★ Gold standard |
| **LJCDS** | School website 3-year matriculation list | Parenthetical counts, 3-year window | ★★★★ Good (different time window) |
| **PRS** | School website 4-year matriculation list | Asterisk (2+) only, no exact counts | ★★☆ Poor — range estimates required |
| ~~FindingSchool~~ | ~~Third-party aggregator~~ | ~~Percentages~~ | ~~★☆ Unreliable — wildly undercounts~~ |

**FindingSchool was the primary source in my original analysis. Cross-checking against school-published data shows it undercounts systematically, especially for schools with less international visibility. I've discarded it entirely.**

### T25 Definition

US News 2024 Top 25 National Universities: Princeton, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Caltech, Duke, JHU, UPenn, Northwestern, UChicago, Columbia, Cornell, Brown, WashU, Rice, Vanderbilt, Dartmouth, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Emory, UMich, UVA, Carnegie Mellon, USC.

### The Numbers

| School | Period | Grads | T25 # | T25 % | HYPSM # | HYPSM % | Data quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bishop's** | 4yr (2021–24) | 528 | **173** | **32.8%** | **46** | **8.7%** | Exact counts |
| **Parker** | 4yr (2021–24) | 526 | **84** | **16.0%** | **18** | **3.4%** | Exact counts |
| **LJCDS** | 3yr (~2022–24) | ~357 | **69** | **~19.3%** | **12** | **~3.4%** | Counted from website |
| **PRS (floor)** | 4yr (2022–25) | 446 | **30** | **6.7%** | **6** | **1.3%** | * = 2 (minimum) |
| **PRS (mid-est)** | 4yr (2022–25) | 446 | **41** | **9.2%** | **8** | **1.8%** | * = 3 (likely) |

### What This Actually Shows

**Three tiers, not the two I originally claimed:**

1. **Tier 1 — Bishop's (33% T25, 9% HYPSM):** In a league of its own in San Diego. UChicago (23 students) and USC (24 students) are massive feeders. Tuition ~$47K.

2. **Tier 2 — Parker & LJCDS (16–19% T25, 3.4% HYPSM):** Very similar to each other. Strong, broad placement across elite schools. Tuition $40–44K.

3. **Tier 3 — PRS (7–9% T25, 1.3–1.8% HYPSM):** Real but meaningfully lower. Roughly half the T25 rate of Tier 2, one-quarter of Tier 1. Tuition $45K.

**The actual gap is 2–3x vs Parker/LJCDS, and 4–5x vs Bishop's.** This is significant but not the "order of magnitude" or "10–20x" I claimed in the original analysis. My original comparison used FindingSchool's 1.79% T25 for PRS against peers' numbers — a comparison built on data I myself identified as suspect.

### Cross-Check: FindingSchool vs Reality

| School | FindingSchool T25% | Actual T25% | Error |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bishop's | 18.75% | 32.8% | **Undercounted 43%** |
| Parker | 16.55% | 16.0% | Roughly correct |
| LJCDS | 11.57% | 19.3% | **Undercounted 40%** |
| PRS | 1.79% | 6.7–9.2% | **Undercounted 74–81%** |

FindingSchool appears to use incomplete data and a narrow methodology. Its figures are unreliable for any school and catastrophically wrong for PRS. **Any analysis comparing schools using FindingSchool percentages across schools is invalid.**

### Community Colleges — Not a PRS-Specific Issue

My original analysis flagged PRS's CC enrollments as a red flag. This was unfair. The data shows **all four schools** send graduates to community colleges:

| School | CC students (4yr/3yr) | As % of grads |
|---|---|---|
| Bishop's | 3 (Saddleback, Santa Monica, Ventura) | 0.6% |
| Parker | 9 (Grossmont 3, SD City 1, SD Mesa 2, SD Miramar 1, SB City 1, Spokane Falls 1) | 1.7% |
| LJCDS | 2 (SD Miramar, Southwestern) | 0.6% |
| PRS | 7+ (MiraCosta 2+, Palomar 2+, SB City 1, SM College 2+) | 1.6%+ |

Parker sends more students to CCs than PRS does. This is a normal part of any school's distribution, not evidence of failure.

## Why the Gap Exists

The T25 gap between PRS and peers is real. The explanations:

1. **Admissions selectivity (biggest factor).** PRS acceptance rate ~90%. Parker/Bishop's are significantly more selective. Higher selectivity = stronger entering class = better outcomes. This is selection effect, not value-added.

2. **Youth.** PRS was founded in 2007 (first grads 2011). Bishop's: 1909. Parker: 1912. LJCDS: 1926. Admissions officer relationships, alumni networks, and institutional brand take decades to build.

3. **Culture and emphasis.** PRS emphasizes holistic development, ethical responsibility, global engagement. Bishop's phased out APs in favor of even more rigorous Honors/Advanced Honors tracks. Bishop's has 5 college counselors for ~128 seniors; PRS has fewer for a similar-sized class.

4. **AP cap.** PRS caps juniors at 3 APs and seniors at 4. Bishop's replaced APs with its own advanced curriculum that is arguably more rigorous. Parker offers 26 APs with no stated cap.

5. **Peer cohort self-selection.** Families who prioritize elite placement disproportionately choose Bishop's and Parker. This concentrates high-achieving, college-obsessed students at those schools. PRS attracts families who prioritize North County convenience and community warmth.

## What PRS Does Well

- **AP scores are legitimately strong** (72% scoring 4–5) — comparable to much more selective peers
- **Harkness pedagogy** is a genuine differentiator, not marketing fluff
- **7:1 ratio** with 15-student classes provides real individual attention
- **Global travel program** with financial aid for trip costs
- **Solid UC pathway**: Berkeley, UCLA, UCSD, UCSB, Davis all asterisked
- **Community warmth** is consistently praised in reviews across multiple platforms

## Corrected Verdict

**PRS's T25 placement is roughly half that of its closest peers (Parker, LJCDS) at similar tuition.** The gap is real and worth knowing, but it's a 2–3x factor, not the 10–20x I originally claimed. PRS is weakest at the very top (HYPSM), where 1–2 students per year is typical.

The gap is overwhelmingly explained by intake selectivity. PRS accepts ~90% of applicants; its peers are far more selective. The question families should ask isn't "which school places better?" but "**what would my kid's outcome be at PRS vs. the alternative?**" — and that depends entirely on the individual student.

**Who PRS makes most sense for:**
- North County families who value proximity (vs. 30–45 min drive to La Jolla)
- Students who would benefit from Harkness-style learning in small classes
- Families who prioritize community and holistic development
- Students aiming for strong UCs, good LACs, or solid private universities

**Who should consider alternatives:**
- Families for whom T25/Ivy placement is the primary goal
- Students who are already very high-performing and would benefit from a more selective peer group

### Ratings (revised)

- College placement: **3/5** (unchanged — the gap is real, just not as extreme)
- Overall educational experience: **4/5**
- Price-to-placement value: **3/5** (revised up from 2.5 — the original rating was based on bad data)

## Methodology Notes

- Bishop's and Parker data from official school profile PDFs (2024-25), extracted via PyMuPDF. These contain exact student counts per institution over 4-year windows. This is the highest-quality data available.
- LJCDS data from school website's 3-year matriculation list with parenthetical counts. Different time window (3 years vs 4) introduces slight apples-to-oranges comparison; rates adjusted to per-year basis are consistent.
- PRS data from school website's 4-year list using asterisk (*) = 2+ students format. I calculate a floor (all * = 2) and mid-estimate (all * = 3). True values could be higher for popular schools (UC Berkeley * could mean 5+) or lower for elite schools (Harvard * likely means exactly 2).
- T25 defined as US News 2024 Top 25 National Universities. Adding T15 LACs would increase all schools' numbers roughly proportionally.
- LJCDS graduating class size estimated from Class of 2024 matriculation count (119 students). Could be off by ±10%.
- Bishop's graduating class count (528 over 4 years, ~132/year) verified by summing all 4-year column entries from the PDF.

### What I Got Wrong in the Original Analysis

1. Used FindingSchool percentages as the backbone of my comparison despite flagging them as unreliable. FindingSchool understated PRS's T25 rate by 74–81%.
2. Claimed "10–20x" and "order of magnitude" gaps. Actual gap: 2–5x depending on peer.
3. Singled out PRS's CC enrollments as a red flag. All four peer schools send students to CCs; Parker sends more than PRS.
4. Attributed deceptive intent to PRS's data format ("likely by design") without evidence.
5. Cited Chicardgo School ECPI (synthetic/modeled data) as if it were observational.
6. Used a 12-year-old acceptance rate for Parker (25% from 2013 Wikipedia) without flagging staleness.
