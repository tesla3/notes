# Critical Review: The Bishop's School College Profile (2025-2026)

**Reviewer perspective:** 20+ years in college admissions across selective public and private universities nationally. This review examines the school profile as an admissions document — what it tells us, what it hides, and how it compares to peer institutions.

---

## Executive Summary

The Bishop's School in La Jolla presents a polished, information-dense college profile that positions it among the top tier of West Coast independent day schools. The matriculation results back this up — this is a school sending meaningful numbers to HYPSM and peer institutions. However, the profile has notable gaps, some strategic ambiguity, and a few choices that would make a seasoned admissions reader pause.

**Overall grade: B+/A-** — Strong document that does the job, but falls short of the precision and transparency I'd expect from the very best school profiles (think Exeter, Andover, Dalton, Lakeside).

## Section-by-Section Analysis

### 1. School Overview & Identity (Page 1)

**What works:**
- Clear founding date, enrollment, class size. The basics are handled cleanly.
- "Drawing from 70 zip codes and 157 middle and high schools" — smart inclusion. This tells me the school draws broadly across San Diego County, not just from La Jolla's wealthy enclave. It signals socioeconomic and geographic diversity without belaboring the point.
- Financial aid numbers up front ($5.2M, 20% of students). Good.
- "All-gender" rather than "coeducational" — a deliberate language choice. Fine, but it will read differently to different admissions offices. At elite coastal schools, this signals alignment with current norms. At some Southern or midwestern institutions, it may raise an eyebrow — not because of the substance but because it signals a particular cultural orientation.

**What gives me pause:**
- "Students of color made up more than 50 percent of the student population." Vague. *More than 50%* could mean 51% or 68%. In a region with San Diego's demographics, 50%+ students of color at a $49,600/year private school is notable — but the hedging feels strategic. If it were 60%+, they'd say 60%+. I'd wager it's 51-53%.
- The school is 800 students **grades 6-12**, but the college profile is about the upper school. This is a mild readability issue — when you say "800 students" and then "129 in the Class of 2026," a quick reader might wonder about the ratio. A one-line clarification (e.g., "approximately 475 students in the upper school") would help.

### 2. Student Life Section (Page 1)

**What works:**
- The advisory program description is well-articulated. 10:1 ratio, same advisor for 4 years, daily meetings. This is the kind of structural detail admissions officers appreciate — it tells us students are known.
- Service requirement (20 hours/year, ~30,000 hours per class by graduation) is concrete and credible.
- Athletics numbers are strong: 80%+ participation, 125 CIF championships, ~20% of seniors competing at the college level.

**What gives me pause:**
- This section is long for a school profile. A full page dedicated to student life — advisory, arts, athletics, leadership, service, social innovation — plus the entire college counseling staff directory and mission/vision/diversity statements. That's a lot of real estate on page 1 that isn't directly serving the admissions reader.
- Most admissions officers reading the profile are trying to answer: *How rigorous is this school? Where does this student sit in context?* Student life matters, but the page 1 information hierarchy here feels like it was designed more for prospective families than for admissions offices.
- **The Social Innovation program** description — "past projects have focused on homelessness, climate change and other urgent social needs" — is vague hand-waving. Either give a concrete example or cut it.

### 3. College Counseling Staff

**What works:**
- Five counselors for ~128-129 seniors. That's approximately a 26:1 ratio, which is very strong. For context, the national average at independent schools is ~40:1, and at public schools it's 400:1+. This ratio is in the range of top-tier boarding schools.
- Full names, direct phone numbers, direct email addresses. This is essential and they do it right.

**What I notice:**
- **Director turnover.** The 2024-25 profile lists Wendy Chang as Director; the 2025-26 profile lists Jim Sargent. Director turnover at a college counseling office is significant — the director is the person who has the deepest relationships with admissions officers at target schools. A new director means a reset on those relationships. This isn't something the profile would flag, obviously, but it's something I'd note. Admissions officers at highly selective schools *know* the counseling directors personally, and a new name means rebuilding trust.

### 4. Academic Program (Page 2)

**What works:**
- The GPA calculation methodology is clearly explained. 4.00 scale, +1.00 for Honors/Advanced Honors, letter grade values specified. This is exactly what admissions officers need.
- No class rank — standard for independent schools of this caliber and not a concern.
- The distinction between Honors, Advanced Honors, and post-AP (‡) courses is clearly articulated. The three-tier system is well-explained.

**The AP Phase-Out — The Elephant in the Room:**

Bishop's completed its AP phase-out in 2021-22. This is now a well-established trend among elite independent schools (Sidwell Friends, Lawrenceville, multiple others). The profile handles it competently:
- States the fact clearly
- Notes that AP exams are still administered for students who want placement/credit
- Uses symbols (*, +, ‡) to map their internal courses to AP equivalencies

**However**, there are real consequences the profile glosses over:

1. **Comparability problem.** When I'm reading 30,000+ applications, AP scores provide a national benchmark. "Honors Chemistry" at Bishop's may be equivalent to AP Chemistry, but I have to *trust* the school on that. The *, +, ‡ system is helpful but requires the reader to decode a legend. At volume, this is friction.

2. **The testing data tells part of the story.** Class of 2025: 94 of 128 students took the SAT (73%), only 27 took the ACT (21%). This is fine — but with no AP scores reported, standardized test scores become the *only* external benchmark. And those scores, while good (1350-1540 middle 50% SAT), are not exceptional for a school charging $49,600. Schools like Harvard-Westlake, Exeter, or Dalton routinely post middle-50% SAT ranges of 1400-1550+.

3. **Year-over-year decline.** Class of 2024 SAT middle 50%: 1360-1550. Class of 2025 SAT middle 50%: 1350-1540. Small decline. Class of 2025 weighted GPA middle 50%: 3.70-4.32. Class of 2026: 3.62-4.22. Both the top and bottom of the GPA range dropped. This is a *one-year snapshot* and I wouldn't over-read it, but the direction is worth watching.

**GPA Distribution — Reading Between the Lines:**

The Class of 2026 middle 50% weighted GPA is **3.62-4.22**. Let's unpack this:
- The bottom of the middle 50% (25th percentile) is 3.62 weighted. On a scale where Honors courses get a full extra point, a 3.62 weighted GPA suggests a mix of B+/A- grades with some Honors bump. This is actually a fairly wide range — it means there's meaningful grade spread.
- The top of the middle 50% (75th percentile) is 4.22 weighted. This means even top-quartile students aren't hitting 4.5+, which suggests the school is *not* wildly inflating grades. This is refreshing. A 4.22 weighted at Bishop's probably means more than a 4.5 weighted at many other independents.
- **Compare to the prior year:** The 2024-25 profile showed 3.70-4.32 for Class of 2025. The range *dropped* for the Class of 2026. Either grading got tighter, course-taking patterns shifted, or this cohort is slightly weaker academically.
- **The absence of an unweighted GPA distribution is notable.** I'd like to see both. The weighted GPA conflates course selection with performance.

**What's missing from the academic section:**
- **Average number of Honors/Advanced Honors courses taken per student.** This is standard at peer schools and its absence is conspicuous.
- **Grade distribution data.** What percentage of grades are A's? This matters enormously for context. If 60% of grades are A or A-, then a 3.62 weighted GPA looks different than if 40% are.
- **AP exam results.** They administer the exams — how do students perform? If the answer is "very well," this would powerfully validate their Honors-as-AP-equivalent claim. If they don't report it, I wonder why.

### 5. Curriculum Grid (Page 3)

**What works:**
- This is comprehensive and well-organized. 150+ courses is credible based on what I see.
- The three-symbol system (*, +, ‡) for rigor levels works. The ‡ designation for "post-AP" courses is particularly useful — it tells me immediately that a student in Advanced Honors Chemistry or Multivariable Calculus is operating beyond typical AP level.
- Course breadth is impressive: 6 world languages (Chinese, French, Latin, Spanish, Greek, plus GOA options), multiple Advanced Honors math courses (Multivariable Calc, Linear Algebra, Number Theory), a full computer science sequence through AI/Computer Vision and Algorithms.
- Independent Study options are genuinely interesting: Asian-American Literature, General Relativity, Disaster Art. This signals intellectual flexibility.
- The Religion & Ethics requirement (Biblical Literature + one elective) is appropriate for an Episcopal school and the elective options are thoughtful (Philosophy of Religion, Race & Religion, Social Justice).

**What gives me pause:**
- **Page 3 is visually dense.** In a print PDF, this is a wall of text in small font. Admissions officers scanning quickly may miss the nuance. The symbol system helps but it requires active decoding.
- **"Social Justice in Amerian Society"** — there's a typo ("Amerian"). It's on both the 2024-25 and 2025-26 profiles. A school charging $49,600 shouldn't have a persistent typo in its official college profile document. This is a small thing but it signals carelessness in a document that's supposed to represent the school to the outside world.
- **Course offerings that change year to year are noted** (e.g., "not offered 2024-2025"). This is helpful but also reveals that some courses are rotational, meaning not every student has access to every listed course. This is common but slightly dilutes the "150+ courses" headline.

### 6. Matriculation Data (Page 4)

**This is the money page,** and it's strong.

**Class of 2025 highlights:**
- Harvard: 3 | MIT: 5 | Stanford: 4 | Princeton: 2 | Yale: 3
- UChicago: 4 | Duke: 2 | Columbia: 2 | UPenn: 3 | Brown: 1
- Georgetown: 1 | Northwestern: 2 | Johns Hopkins (not listed for '25 single year)
- UC Berkeley: 3 | UCLA: 1 | USC: 4 | Michigan: 3

**4-Year totals (Classes of 2022-2025) — the real story:**
- USC: 21 (largest single destination — La Jolla proximity + wealth + legacy culture)
- UChicago: 17 | Wisconsin: 15 | UC Berkeley: 14 | Michigan: 14
- Northeastern: 13 | UCLA: 11 | SMU: 13 | MIT: 13 | Santa Clara: 15
- Harvard: 11 | Stanford: 10 | Princeton: 10 | Yale: 9
- Cornell: 7 | Georgetown: 7 | Duke: 8 | Penn: 8 | Boston College: 8 | Bowdoin: 8

**My read as an admissions officer:**

This is a legitimately strong matriculation list. A school of ~128 graduates placing 3+ at Harvard and 5 at MIT in a single year is notable. The HYPSM 4-year total of ~54 students out of ~512 graduates (roughly 10.5%) puts Bishop's in elite company among day schools nationally.

**However:**
1. **The matriculation list uses "enrolled," not "accepted."** This is the right approach and I respect it — it shows where kids actually *go*, not where they got in. But I'd also like to see acceptance data somewhere. Many peer schools provide both.

2. **The USC number (21 over 4 years) is revealing.** USC is a fine school, but it's the #1 destination for this school by a wide margin, and it correlates with the socioeconomic profile of La Jolla families. This number likely includes recruited athletes, legacy admissions, and development cases. It doesn't diminish the HYPSM numbers, but it tells you something about the full picture.

3. **The "4-Year Total" column is smart strategy.** By aggregating 4 years, the list looks much more impressive — Princeton: 10! Harvard: 11! Stanford: 10! — but remember these are totals over 4 graduating classes of ~128 each (~512 graduates total). Any single year will have gaps. This is standard practice but it's worth noting for the reader.

4. **Some conspicuous single-year absences from the Class of 2025:** No Johns Hopkins (6 over 4 years), no Dartmouth listed for '25, no Cornell for '25 (7 over 4 years). These fluctuations are normal for a school this size but notable.

5. **The community college entries** (Santa Monica College: 1, Ventura College: 1) are quietly included. I actually respect this — "we celebrate all students' post-secondary plans" isn't just rhetoric. But it also confirms that the 100% four-year college claim in the academic section isn't quite accurate — or these students are starting at CC with plans to transfer.

6. **San Diego State (8 over 4 years), a couple of CSU campuses, UC Merced** — the presence of these alongside HYPSM shows the school has genuine range and isn't just a factory for the top 20 schools. This is healthy.

7. **International placements** are notable: Cambridge (1), Edinburgh (2), Trinity Dublin (1), McGill (2), University of Toronto (2), St. Andrews (1), American University of Paris (1). This suggests a globally-minded student body — or at least a counseling office that supports international applications, which not all schools do well.

## What's Missing — And Why It Matters

1. **Acceptance rate data.** How many students applied to Harvard? If 3 matriculated out of 30 applicants, that's a 10% rate (roughly in line with the national average). If 3 matriculated out of 8 applicants, that's extraordinary counseling. The omission of acceptance data is a choice, and it likely means the numbers aren't as impressive as the matriculation list alone would suggest.

2. **Average number of Honors/Advanced Honors courses per student.** Without this, I can't calibrate whether a student taking 4 Honors courses is above average, average, or below average at Bishop's.

3. **AP exam performance.** If their Honors courses truly meet or exceed AP rigor, the AP exam results would prove it. Silence here is conspicuous.

4. **Faculty credentials detail.** The main website says 85% hold advanced degrees; Private School Review says 89%. The profile itself doesn't include this. For a school of this caliber, I'd expect to see: "X% hold terminal degrees (PhD/MFA/JD), Y% hold master's degrees."

5. **Average class size.** Mentioned on external sites as 14, but not in the profile itself. The website says 9:1 student-teacher ratio; Wikipedia says 8:1. These discrepancies should be reconciled.

6. **College counseling process timeline.** The website says counselors start meeting individually in 10th grade; the profile doesn't describe the process at all beyond listing staff. A brief description of how counseling works would add value.

7. **Summer program/gap year data.** Do any graduates take gap years? How many? This is increasingly relevant.

## Peer Comparison

How does Bishop's stack up against peer independent day schools?

| Metric | Bishop's | Harvard-Westlake | Lakeside (Seattle) | Collegiate (NYC) |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Tuition | $49,600 | ~$47,000-49,000 | ~$42,000 | ~$60,000 |
| Class size | ~128 | ~290 | ~135 | ~50 |
| SAT mid-50% | 1350-1540 | ~1400-1560 | ~1380-1540 | ~1420-1560 |
| HYPSM 4yr % | ~10.5% | ~15%+ | ~12% | ~20%+ |
| Counselor ratio | ~26:1 | ~50:1 | ~30:1 | ~12:1 |
| Endowment | $70M | $470M+ | $180M+ | $150M+ |

Bishop's is in the conversation with these schools but clearly a tier below on resources (endowment is shockingly low at $70M for a school of this profile) and modestly below on academic metrics. The counselor ratio is a genuine strength.

## Final Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Matriculation results speak for themselves — this is a legitimately elite prep school
- Curriculum depth and rigor architecture (Honors → Advanced Honors → post-AP) is well-designed and clearly communicated
- College counseling staffing is excellent
- Honest inclusion of full matriculation range (not just trophy placements)
- Financial aid, while limited in reach (20%), is mentioned transparently

**Weaknesses:**
- Profile is slightly too long and front-loaded with marketing language rather than data
- AP phase-out explanation could be stronger — show me the AP exam results that validate the claim
- GPA and test score data are good, not great, for the price point
- Missing standard data points (Honors course averages, acceptance rates, grade distributions)
- Persistent typo in the curriculum section across multiple years signals quality control issues
- $70M endowment is thin for institutional stability and limits financial aid growth
- Director of College Counseling turnover year-over-year

**Bottom line:** When a student from The Bishop's School lands on my desk, I know what I'm getting — a well-prepared student from a rigorous environment with strong support systems. The profile does enough to establish institutional credibility, but it could do more to provide the precise data points that help me contextualize individual applicants. For a school that aspires to compete with the Exeters and Lakesides of the world, the profile should be tighter, more data-driven, and less reliant on aspirational language.

The school is real. The results are real. The profile just needs to get out of its own way.
