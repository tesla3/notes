## The Article (Elliot Bonneville, Feb 18 2026)

Core thesis: AI has collapsed the cost of *creation* to near-zero, so **attention** is now the scarce resource. Since attention/reach requires money or years of accumulated audience, money is the only remaining moat for new entrants. Quotes Josh Pigford (25-year internet veteran) saying for the first time it feels genuinely hard to make money building *new* things. The author launched a product ("Kith" — a paid, no-AI, verified-human social network), got 14 signups, looked at the growth math, and flinched.

## The Article's Two Claims (which must be separated)

**Claim 1 (empirical):** It is harder than ever to get attention for new digital products. Every distribution channel — search, social, newsletters, Show HN — has gotten worse. Supply of "things competing for eyeballs" has exploded; eyeballs haven't.

**Claim 2 (structural):** Therefore, money is the only remaining moat.

Claim 1 has strong evidence and broad agreement, even from skeptics in the thread. Claim 2 is the provocative overstatement. Most of the interesting discussion is about *why Claim 2 is wrong* while *Claim 1 is still alarming*.

## Six Genuine Insights from the Thread

### 1. The real scarce resource shifted, and most builders haven't adjusted

The article's best line: "Creation used to be the scarce thing. Now attention is. Most of us are on the wrong side of that trade." This is correct and underappreciated. For decades, technical skill was the bottleneck — if you could build it, you had an advantage. AI collapsed that bottleneck. Now everyone can build. The scarce resource is the *allocation of attention*, and that is controlled by platforms (Google, social algorithms, app stores) — not by individual builders. The real "money is the moat" argument isn't about marketing budgets. It's about who controls the attention infrastructure.

### 2. The threshold / phase-transition nature of reach is the cruelest structural feature

Below some invisible line, effort produces *literally nothing*. Above it, growth compounds without you. A YouTuber in the thread confirmed this from experience: "Your videos are not good enough to watch until one day they suddenly are." This means identical quality and effort produce wildly different outcomes depending on which side of the line you're on. This isn't about money specifically — but money lets you brute-force past the threshold. Without it, you're gambling on organic escape velocity, which has always been a long-odds bet but is getting longer as the supply of competitors grows.

### 3. "Non-scalable work" is advice for survival, not ambition — and it has a ceiling the thread mostly ignored

The Taleb advice (do non-scalable work like welding or tailoring) is really saying: *cap your upside to eliminate your exposure to winner-take-all dynamics*. That's legitimate risk management. But the thread was full of tech workers romanticizing trades they've never done. The *actual* problems with this advice:

- Non-scalable work caps your income at local labor market rates, by definition.
- It doesn't protect you from *sideways* disruption (the dry cleaner killed by remote work, not by cleaning robots).
- You can't predict what's "post-peak automation." Programming seemed non-scalable 10 years ago.
- The advice is for economic *resilience*, not for someone asking how to build something new — which is what the article was actually about.

### 4. "You can ship in a week what FAANGs spent billions on" is delusional

This was the most cleanly demolished claim in the thread. Apple Pay's value wasn't code — it was Visa/Mastercard relationships and a decade of hardware positioning. A WhatsApp clone built in a week gets zero users. What got cheaper was the *MVP*, not the *product*. As one commenter put it: "I'm baffled by what people think can pass as a product in a real sense." The LLM era has inflated people's sense of what they've accomplished by conflating *technical demo* with *viable product*.

### 5. The "are we the horses?" question is genuinely unresolved, and both sides argue badly

- The optimist case ("95% of farmers lost jobs → new jobs appeared") is facile. It glosses over *generations* of immiseration during the transition and treats the endpoint as inevitable rather than the result of specific political and institutional responses.
- The pessimist case ("we are the horses") is also sloppy. Horses have no political agency, no ability to retrain, no capacity to create new demand categories. Humans do. The analogy is vivid but structurally broken.
- The genuinely new thing neither side reckons with: previous automation waves replaced *specific physical or cognitive tasks* one at a time. AI targets *general cognition across multiple domains simultaneously* — code, copy, design, analysis, marketing. The rate and breadth matter, not just the principle.

### 6. Domain-specific complacency is the mirror-image error of catastrophizing

A finance commenter dismissed AI as "a toy" and claimed AGI is "5000 years away" because high-stakes finance doesn't use vibe-coded output. This reveals more about the speaker's emotional need for security than about the actual trajectory of the technology. It's the inverse of the article's catastrophizing — both are coping, just in opposite directions.

## What the Thread Actually Reveals

The article is directionally right about *one thing*: the supply-side explosion in digital products is real, attention is genuinely scarcer relative to supply, and the channels for organic discovery are degrading. This is not just "business was always hard."

But the article is wrong about the conclusion. **Money is not the only moat. Money is the *laziest* moat.** The thread surfaced better ones:

- **Relationships and trust** (the subcontractor who becomes an approved vendor over years)
- **Regulatory/certification barriers** (submarine welders, financial compliance)
- **Physical locality** (you can't offshore a plumbing repair)
- **Deep domain expertise** (knowing what to build, not just being able to build it)
- **Accumulated audience** (which is really a form of trust at scale)

The uncomfortable truth the thread circles but never quite states: **all of these moats are slow.** They take years. The article's real anxiety — shared by many in the thread — isn't that money is the only moat. It's that *patience* is the only moat, and we're in a culture and an industry that has trained people to expect fast feedback loops. The phase transition in reach means you might invest years and get nothing, or you might invest years and break through. There is no way to know in advance. That uncertainty is what's actually terrifying, and money is just the most visible way people try to buy their way out of it.

## Common HN Pushbacks (and their quality)

| Pushback | Quality | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| "Author is discovering business" | **Weak.** Dismisses a 25-year veteran (Pigford) noting structural change as naivety. | Coping via condescension. |
| "Creation is still hard if you want to succeed" | **Medium.** True but sidesteps the supply flood. The *bar* rose, but the *noise* rose faster. | |
| "Ideas are worthless, execution matters" | **Misapplied.** The article isn't about ideas vs execution — it's about execution vs distribution. | |
| "Just build for a niche" | **Good but incomplete.** Niches are real shelter. But platforms can intermediate even niches (Uber Eats, Booking.com). | |
| "Non-scalable work is the answer" | **Survival advice, not growth advice.** Caps upside. Vulnerable to sideways disruption. | |
| "AI is a toy" | **Weak.** Domain complacency. The fact that your corner isn't disrupted yet ≠ safety. | |
